Functional Image processing
======

## REPL

### I don't know what the hell is SBT!! ¯¯\\_(ツ)_/¯¯ 

Just type this

```
> ./activator
```

### C'mon! I already have everything installed

```
> sbt
```

## Testing

### How do I run the test?

Once in the _REPL_

```
> test
> testOnly fr.xebia.image.*
> testOnly fr.xebia.image.core.RawImageSpec
> ~testOnly fr.xebia.image.core.RawImageSpec
```

You are good to go!!!
